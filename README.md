# Astro-WalE

Instructions:
1. Take pull of branch: RakeshRav-WalE
2. Due to security issues i am not pushing my API key, you can simply introduce field in gradle.properties
   "API_KEY" type "String" and provide your API key there. Since it is public repo it can be misused.WalE
3. Sync project and run


Area of improvement
1. All the version of gradle dependency can be taken out to build.gradle(project level).
   so that it can be used with multimodular app with same version of each dependency across the different modules.
